# NourishNow

## 5 day meal planner 
The purpose and motivation for building this Web Application was to help busy professionals plan their meals for the work week based on their dietary requirements. It is designed to save users the time and hassle of selecting meals and creating shopping lists. 

Nourish Now creates the users meal plan, helps them collate a shopping list, and locates the closest supermarket no matter where they might be. 

## Usage

*Navigate in your browser to the Nourish Now landing page using this [link]((https://dtran44.github.io/NourishNow/)

Once the user is on the landing page they can click the 'Start you Nourish Plan' button to begin
