# NourishNow

## 5 day meal planner 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Usage

*Navigate in your browser to the Nourish Now landing page using this 'LINK'*

Once the user is on the landing page they can click the 'Start you Nourish Plan' button to begin

The user is then directed to select from three diet types; Carvivore, Vegetarian, or Vegan. To select diet preference, the user can simply click on the correlating button.

Once one of these options is selected, the user is presented with their 5 day meal plan in the format of breakfast, lunch and dinner based on their dietary preference.

The user can then click on any of the breakfast, lunch and dinner image tiles to view the recipe of that meal.

If the user has mistakenly selected the incorrect diet, they can navigate back to the diet select section to reselect their preference using the 'Back' button at the botton of this section. The user may also not be satified with the meals that were generated, so there is a 'Regenerate' button at the bottom of this section which will randomly select a new plan from their diet preference.
